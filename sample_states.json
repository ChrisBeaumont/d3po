The [Fe/H] of each star was inferred following the methods described in Newton et al. (2013), which use the equivalent width of the Na line near 2.2 microns as a proxy for metallicity. You can see that a metal-rich star is seen to have a different color than a more metal-poor star of the same spectral type. This allowed us to calibrate a relation for iron abundance using 2MASS photometry.",
